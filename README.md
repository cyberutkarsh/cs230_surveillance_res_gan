# Up-sampling low resolution surveillance feeds usingGANs
## CS230 Project to Upscale Surveillance Videos using GANs

### This repo consists of 3 implementations of Video Upscaling
- Baseline Approach: Sub-pixel CNN Based Video Up-sampling
- Proposed Approach 1: Enhanced SRGAN Based Video Up-sampling
- Proposed Approach 2: Recurrent Back-Projection Networks (RBPN) + SRGAN Based Video Up-sampling

### Implementations
- Sub-pixel CNN Based Video Up-sampling (Baseline Version) is fully implemented at  
[subpixel_cnn_upscale](https://github.com/cyberutkarsh/cs230_surveillance_res_gan/tree/main/baseline_cnn_vids_upscale)
- Enhanced SRGAN Based Video Up-sampling is fully implemented at  
[esrgan_upscale](https://github.com/cyberutkarsh/cs230_surveillance_res_gan/tree/main/esrgan)
- Recurrent Back-Projection Networks (RBPN) + SRGAN Based Video Up-sampling (Baseline Version) is fully implemented at  
[rbpn_srgan_upscale](https://github.com/cyberutkarsh/cs230_surveillance_res_gan/tree/main/iSeeBetter)

#### README file exists in each imaplementation directory to walk through installation and train and score process.
